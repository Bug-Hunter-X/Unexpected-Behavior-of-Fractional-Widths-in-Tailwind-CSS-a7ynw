```html
<div class="flex">
  <div class="bg-red-500 p-4 w-1/2"></div>
  <div class="bg-blue-500 p-4 w-1/2"></div>
</div>
```
This code snippet uses `w-1/2` to make each div take up half the width. However, if the parent div doesn't have a defined width, the divs will not take up half of the available space. They'll just take up half of their available space which is unbounded and will overflow.
